### TODO

- handle scrolling in Input
- AAsset should be its own component which is then wrapped by a loader or
writer depending on the request (use more templates)
???? get information about the monitor from window
- segment classes by using comments for separating setters and getters etc.
??? should ABasicWindowRequests be implemented using lambdas instead???

check packages:
- assetmngr
- reqmngr
