### TODO

- handle scrolling in Input
???? get information about the monitor from window
??? should ABasicWindowRequests be implemented using lambdas instead???
- remove cringe
- add closing/disposing methods to classes
- think whether an input of each method of each component can be null 
(the appropriate level of null checking)
