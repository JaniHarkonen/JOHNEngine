### TODO

- handle scrolling in Input
- AAsset should be its own component which is then wrapped by a loader or
writer depending on the request (use more templates)
???? get information about the monitor from window (maybe?)
- segment classes by using comments for separating setters and getters etc.
- classes extending AAsset should implement a default return method that will be used when
the underlying asset hasn't been yet loaded
